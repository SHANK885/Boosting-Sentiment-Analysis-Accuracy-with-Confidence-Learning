I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease.

I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease.

Now the battery will no longer hold a charge at all.  Which is incredibly sad when you are paying so much for a product that works really well.

My induction rechargeable toothbrush has a better set up; it has lasted for 6 years and is still going strong.  Come on Clarisonic - I am not the only one who has brought this topic up.  There is an entire group of YouTube videos dedicated to detailing how to break into your products in the complicated process solely to swap out the cheap battery for a low cost - high quality battery.\nTreat your customers with a little more respect.\n===========================================\n\nMy wife likes to call this her \"little genie\".  The bristles are gentle on the skin, yet provide a thorough, deep pore cleansing.  The rotating head vibrates enough to be effecting, but not so fast that it feels like a grinding wheel and the entire package is easy to hold in your palm.  Great for control and being easy to reach all the areas of your face. The motor is powerful and does not get bogged down and the charge lasts a really long time. It has two speeds - one for extra gentle - but she rarely uses this speed.  Plus the entire package is waterproof.  To charge, just rest it in the cradle charger provided.\n\nMy wife like to use her preferred cleanser (not a bar of soap). Her recommendation is to keep the brush head clean and dry when not in use.  In other words, don't use it, put it down and just walk away.  Keep the head clean and make sure it dries really well between use.  She sets hers bristle down on a folded sheet of paper towel.

Will be throwing out and getting something different.\n\nFirst, and perhaps not so important, this straighter does have a sleek look. It's lightweight and narrow, unlike some of the bulky straighteners I've owned in the past. This is a plus as it takes up less counter space and isn't an eyesore.\n\nThere is one button that controls on/off and the temperature of the device. Holding down the button turns it on/off, while double clicking allows for temperature control. Above the button there is a series of lights that change depending on the temperature and indicate that the straighter is heating vs ready to use. While, as far as I can tell, this type of control set-up does work, the different temperatures are not noted on the device. I use the same temp every time, so this doesn't affect me as much, but, if you might need to adjust the heat, you'll have to check the instructions pamphlet for temp ranges.\n\nI have admittedly thin hair, but it is naturally curly. I had no problem straightening the majority with only one pass, but some of the more finicky bits, like my bedhead bangs, took a bit more finesse.\n\nAs a plus, this straightener did come with two hair clips to divide and twist up hair when straightening.

Drying time really depends on oil content of your skin.  It actually took about 12 minutes to totally dry on my face, especially around my nose where I have high oil concentration.  It came off quite smoothly in the shower and did not get stuck in hairy areas of my mustache, eyebrows, and hair line.  It did provide me with an invigorating tingling feeling that I enjoy and seemed to remove blackheads well.\n\n\"The only thing prohibitive of regular usage would be the cost.

I bought this curling iron for my wife, after reading online reviews.  She LOVED this curling iron.  She liked that it heated up fast, opened and closed well, gripped her hair when she wanted it to, and let go when it was supposed to.\n\nI couldn't say exactly when it went from \"love\" to less than that.  But it started probably around the two year mark, after being used on average, about once per week.  It started to not heat up really well, and I think that there had been a flaw of some kind in the power cord, at the point where the cord attaches to the swivel connection on the iron.  There was no visible problem, anywhere on the cord.  It eventually got to the point where it didn't heat at all.  That was probably in this last year, so it was a good 2-3 years old, I would say.\n\nSo this last winter, about 2/2014, I took the thing apart, and couldn't find a thing wrong.  I put it back together and kind of told my wife that it was her imagination--I don't know, I think I was just too busy at the time to be bothered.  Then when I saw her a few weeks later using another old curling iron, and I asked her why she wasn't using the her favorite, and she said it just doesn't work anymore.  So I figured maybe she wasn't making it up :)\n\nI took it apart again, and put an ohm meter on the cord part, and it was not good.  I figured it unlikely that it was in the actual cord.  So I started to cut into the thick part of the cord where it had a reinforced curve in it, and was able to get down to where I found that there must have been a break there.  I cut that part of the cord out, soldered the cord onto the connectors that had been inside that molded reinforced curve, and put all of it back together with epoxy as something of a new homemade connection to reinforce it, and she was off and running again.\n\nThen in just the last few months, probably when the curling iron was about 3 1/2 years old, my wife started complaining that the curling iron was not gripping her hair well enough, and was slipping, and also that it was making a squeaking sound whenever she opened and closed the pincers--don't know if that's the right term.  I am also not sure I understand another comment that she made, though, that she has trouble getting her hair out of it when she finds it is slipping.\n\nAnyway, all of that doesn't matter.  I just looked at the spring area and could see that up underneath where the spring is, the point that contacts the pincer just below the thumb knob, there is a tiny roller that helps the spring to slide quietly back and forth, that was off center, and it also wasn't rolling anymore.  It was mostly sliding.  So I adjusted it to the side a little, and liberally sprayed some dry lubricant on it.  The action works better, and it doesn't make any noise, so we will have to wait until she uses it again to see if it works.\n\nSo as of today 6/16/2014, the iron is still going after approximately 200+ uses, albeit with some required tweaking to keep it out of the garbage.  I would like to believe that the power cord issue that we had was a rare defect, and that most people never run into that.  I'm thinking that most people could use this iron over 200 times and probably just be starting to have a squeaky spring issue, and that's about it.  If I were to have to start this product search again, I would definitely take a chance again on this iron, and hope that we didn't get the cord defect in that reinforced bend near the swivel.\n\nFor the money, and the use that we've had with this, I think it's a great deal.

Also, I saw the inside of it when I was working on it, and although the parts were adequate, I would be cheating a curling iron with better quality parts that deserved the five stars, if I were to give this one five.\n\nAs I've said in other reviews that I've written, to me, either four or five stars is a \"buy with confidence\" in my book.

I never bought any because of the price, and, I am not all that self conscious about my balding anyway.  However when a good friend of mine got some for his thinning hair I was so impressed by how it good it looked that I begged him to let me use it just once.  The color wasn't exactly right but that didn't matter since it was only a test... Unfortunately I have to say that even though it worked very well on my friends hair that is only thinning, it was a total bomb for me who has a real beach head coming in on the top.  Quite simply, one has to pay very close attention to the description of how this stuff says it works.  It clearly states that it needs or works by bonding with your existing hair.  If you have either no, or hardly any existing hair, it just comes out looking like a lot of very homely fuzzy stuff.  I tried it all over the top of my head and it simply stuck to it, and then ended up looking like some kind of very short, fuzzy, sparsely covered type dog hair.  Very ugly and fake looking and not at all worth the price or the bother for sure....\n\nAs for how it worked for my friend I have nothing but praise.  It was amazing the way it blended in and stuck to what thinning hair he had and combed out looking completely natural.  If you really want to see how this stuff looks in use, type the name of it into google and go to videos.  There are several online that depict a true demonstration of how good this stuff works on thinning hair.  Even on very thinning hair.  But not a one I found showed someone with a real Dr. Phil look, or even just a completely bare bald spot.  Without some minimal hair to cling to you are like me, fresh out of luck and too late.  If my hair was only thinning I would consider the hefty price of this worth it I believe.  Just remember for the truly bald, its a bust...\n\nIn conclusion, I decided to take off one star on the rating simply because I feel that despite this working very well on thinning hair, I believe that the description should more forcefully state that its not for bald heads. I don't think it does clearly enough to satisfy me. Not even the manufacturers web site that has a more detailed description says anything about bald heads.  Personally I feel that the majority of the negative reviews of it comes from those that are too far ahead with hair loss and just came out with a big fail on their part.  It was with me for sure.  Highly recommended only  for those with thinning hair that this stuff can cling too, and that feel hiding it well is worth the price... : )"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-56091", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I was skeptical but my nails were so bad I had to try it on a friend's rec.

Being a veteran weeaboo, the first safety razor I tried was some legit Japanese stuff (forgot the brand, sorry) paired with Feather blades.  I have delicate, sensitive little girl's skin marred with big red-black thick quasi-Lovecraftian double-sprouting beard hairs; surely some sort of punishment for past-life atrocities.  After using the Japanese blades, my face was left as bloody as a Tarantino movie set in the after-hours.  I thought I'd get the hang of it with practice.  I didn't, and ended up giving up and going back to selling my internal organs in order to afford Mach 3 razors.\n\nSince moving to Germany, my second attempt was this Merkur 23C, with its weird blade wings thingie.  I used Astra blades because I found an affordable 100-pack at Amazon.de.  The combo works well enough.  The only thing I can't achieve with it is the mythical \"one-stroke shaving\" which wet shaving forums on the Internet preach of.  Like, apparently you're supposed to caress your face with a single Meistestroke with, while following the grain, would close-shave all your beard hairs in one go even as they clean the foam elegantly like an enlightened Zen swordsmonk sweeping a rock garden, leaving nary a shade behind. If stubble is  left at all, it means you suck, but you're allowed to lather up again and draw a second, shameful stroke at a right angle to the grain.  If even then there are still hairs left, you can do a final, desperate stroke against the grain, and then presumably live-stream your seppuku for TheShaveDen elders.\n\nNo matter how I try it, after three strokes not even Jesus would be generous enough to call my face anywhere near \"shaved\".  My shaving process end up looking more like Jackson Pollock's \"Autumn Rhythm\", with dozens of strokes going upwards, downwards, diagonalwards, irregularly around facial features, in Golden Ratio spirals etc.  Despite all this abuse, this razor does not leave me burned or bleeding at all, which I take to be quite the achievement.  It doesn't achieve a close shave either, but then again neither does Mach 3, which costs ten gazillion dollars in the long-term and also makes me bleed a whole lot.\n\nOne day I'll save big bucks, go to some laser hair removal shop of renown, burn every. single. strand of beard hair back to the pits of Hell where they came from, and then post it on Art of Manliness to troll masculinity-worshippers.

I have a light/medium skin tone and this looked very unnatural/whited-out on me.

I have taken to applying this over a sheer matte pink-toned lip color to balance some of the whiteness out.

It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.\n\nHere's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon\n-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)\n-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)\n-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner\n-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )\n**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**\n-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)\n-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum\n\n(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is \"Black don't crack\". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)\n\n***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.\n\nI hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases!

You apply it to your clean  face and neck avoiding the eye area.  It dries in 5 to 10 minutes.  You then remove it using warm water.\n\n\"I tried this product before my morning shower.  It went on much smoother than the masks I am accustomed to using.  It felt creamier and got into difficult areas around nose and creases in neck.  Drying time really depends on oil content of your skin.  It actually took about 12 minutes to totally dry on my face, especially around my nose where I have high oil concentration.  It came off quite smoothly in the shower and did not get stuck in hairy areas of my mustache, eyebrows, and hair line.  It did provide me with an invigorating tingling feeling that I enjoy and seemed to remove blackheads well.\n\n\"The only thing prohibitive of regular usage would be the cost.  My normal facial mask product is Queen Helene Mudd Pack or Mint Julep which sells for $4 for 8 ounces.

I have recommended them to clients with skin sensitivities and in most cases they have been very happy with their performance.  Once in a while, however, I come across a product which I am not as fond of.  This, unfortunately, happens to be one of them.\n\nWHAT IS THIS CLEANSER LIKE?\nA nice sized bottle, I do like the color of the cleanser.  It reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.  The label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mario-Badescu-The-Moisture-Magnet-SPF-15-2-oz/dp/B0015Z532O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mario Badescu The Moisture Magnet SPF 15, 2 oz.</a>.\n\nHOW DOES THIS CLEANSING SOAP PERFORM?\nA little goes  along way of this stuff.  It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.\n\nI have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.\n\nIn both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.\n\nI have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.\n\nTHE WORST PART- ITCHING\nThe worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nGreat sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.\n\nI have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  For us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-66393", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "The brush is great for keeping the my beard smooth, tame and sexy.

The stress caused my skin to well up in a way I've never experienced before, and it was so tragic it actually distracted me from the break-up. My skin has never been clear, and I had experienced cystic bumps here and there prior to this incident. However, I looked like I had suffered an extreme chemical burn that blistered the entire lower portion of my face.\n\nPanicked, I went to Ulta to find makeup strong enough to cover my monstrous appearance yet gentle enough not to exasperate it. That's when I was directed to this Juice Beauty kit, in an effort to \"change the canvas, not paint over it\" as the Ulta rep (with flawless, glowing skin) put it. I bought it with extremely low expectations and extremely high chagrin.\n\nAbout a week later, I was put on Accutane. This is an extremely powerful medication for only the worst acne sufferers. My doctor forbade me from using any products that were not designed for sensitive skin, so I had to shelve my Juice Beauty kit.\n\nFlash forward to May. I took myself off Accutane because of the horrendous, non-acne related side effects (extreme hair loss, muscle weakness, depression). My skin now, however, is relatively clear, albeit scarred deeply on my cheeks. Since the drug stays in your system for a month after your last dosage, I had to wait before using anything not labeled \"sensitive skin\".\n\nNow it's June. I pulled out my Juice Beauty kit after two little pimples started sprouting on my face. I used the wash in the morning (I use a gentle, cream cleanser at night) and the serum at night under a heavy moisturizer. I used the peel once, and sporadically use the oil-free moisturizer. My pimples were gone in two days! I've also noticed that my scar tissue is less pronounced, as I believe the product is evening my skin tone.\n\nMy final thoughts: 1) Don't expect a miracle, especially if you have cystic acne. See a doctor. 2) This kit works best for people with acne-lite, meaning those irritating chicks that cry when they get a single spot on their faces. Basically, people who are non-acne sufferers that occasionally break out. 3) Best products in this kit are definitely the serum and the wash. They really do work, and they're gentle. I will definitely be repurchasing them. 4) The moisturizer leaves a bizarre, sticky finish and the peel felt pointless. Smelled, looked, and felt like applesauce. If you're into that, awesome, but those two products were let downs for me.\n\nHopefully this very thorough review helps some of y'all that are suffering. Believe me, I know what it's like. I simply think it's silly that some of the reviews on here are actually blaming the product for their acne... Acne comes from within 99% of the time, so you have to address that before any single product can help you.\n\nMuch love everyone! :)"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-52822", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "dont put it on top of your head .

My one and only complaint is that it breaks extremely easy when dropped. I was sitting down drying my hair on the double (a rug on the carpet)carpeted floor and mistakenly dropped it. I honestly didn't drop it hard or far.....about 2 feet from the carpet at most. Well the inside of the BD broke into a gazillion plastic pieces and stopped working.

I have dropped BD's from much higher and on tile and it still held up.

The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.

It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.\n\nI have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.\n\nIn both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.\n\nI have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.\n\nTHE WORST PART- ITCHING\nThe worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nGreat sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.\n\nI have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.

Not only to you need the brush to perform well, but be durable and stand up to cleaning.  Let's see how the Japonesque Kumadori Countour/Highlight Brush measures up.\n\nWHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?\nThis brush is about 6 1/2\" long with the handle being 5\" and the brush head 1 1/2\" long.  The brush head is about 1 3/8\" wide at its widest point.  The shape of the brush is a teardrop shape.  The bristles are natural and they are not at all dense in the way they are packed.  I would put this more in the fluffy category and not dense.\n\nThe handle is tapered, but the base seems to be a rubbery base underneath.  A rim of that material is visible up near the base of the brush head.  The rest of the handle is wrapped with a natural piece of what resembles thin wicker.  I am not sure what the actual name of it is.  It is wrapped and glued down with the end tucked up under at the top.  It simply ends at the tip of the handle and is not tucked down.  The surface texture of the wrapped handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate in your hand, although in certain positions it can feel rough.\n\nHOW DOES THIS BRUSH PERFORM?\nAs for performance, this brush does not do too well picking up product from a pan unless the pan of makeup is very very soft and easily picked up.  It does not disperse the product as equally on the skin as I would like.  I have tried this with blush, bronzer and highlighter, but I find that it seems to work best with Guerlain Meteorites.\n\nThat is not necessarily a bad thing as Guerlain Meteorites are little balls of product which are in different colors.  It is hard to find a brush which applies them well.  They act more as a highlight or finishing powder in a very subtle manner.\n\nThis brush would also work decently with mineral makeup.  The tip makes it get into smaller spaces of the face like around the nose and inner eyes, but is broad enough to use on the rest of the face and under the chin.\n\nI did not find that the bristles were dense or sturdy enough to pick up sufficient product to apply to the skin evenly from pans of color such as contour or highlight.\n\nI tend to get better results from brushes in that same shape but much higher density than this one is.\n\nWHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BRUSH\nMy biggest problem with this brush is that it is not going to be easy to clean.  Brushes are meant to be used and that means they will get dirty.  Sometimes handles will also get dirty.  In the case of this brush, the handle being wrapped by the wicker like pieces, I don't see this brush being easy to clean.  The bristles being wet only is possible, but any moisture at all on this handle is bound to make it come apart eventually.\n\nI imagine if you were to coat the handle with something that would withstand moisture, you could probably still use this brush and it would be more practical.  That way the handle would not unwrap with constant cleaning and you could still enjoy the brush.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nIf used for application of light powdery highlights or contour that is not packed hard in a pan, or sphere powders like Guerlain Meteorites, this brush would be good.  For use where you want to deposit color more evenly from pans of product, it is not the best brush. The composition of the handle makes it not practical to clean as if the handle becomes wet over time, the handle will probably come apart.  It you are a brush collector and love unusual brushes, and the practicality of this does not matter to you, then you might still love this brush.  If you are a practical person who uses their brushes a lot and likes to keep them clean all of the time, this might not be the brush for you.\n\nI have rated this two stars because I feel that it just isn't practical for makeup use that leads to lots of cleaning for that price."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-78160", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Well I tried it the first day and no results with toning stomach so will finish it !

Tried their shamp/cond & bar soap products as well thinking the Tea Tree Oil line would be my cure-all for skin conditions and overall I'm thoroughly disappointed.\n\n[INITIAL REVIEW]: Wow I love this stuff! It's a great moisturizer! I don't think I'll use it as a leave in conditioner because I have long, fine hair and any product added usually just weighs my hair down & makes it feel greasy/heavy. So only reviewing as a skin moisturizer and dang this stuff is awesome! Wish I could underline lol! Awesome because of the smell (I know I'm going to lose a few people here, but I actually like the kind of minty, citronella candle smell), it absorbs quickly and thoroughly, which is definitely something that is hard to find. Even some lotions that say they absorb with no greasy feeling don't cut it and this stuff does! It seems to be helping my eczema! It's almost cleared up my arms and has nearly completely cleared up my hands including some hard, scaly patches that almost look like psoriasis, though I've never been diagnosed with that skin condition. I've used it all over my body and so far my only (very mild) complaint is, it made the skin of my face & neck break out so I will stick to Clinique products on my face, but everywhere else get's a nice, soothing coating of PM Tea Tree Oil Moisturizer.

The only way to have my hair take a style other than mid-electrocution is to use some sort of product. Ive tried lots of different things (pomades, styling creams, not showering, Mobil 5W30) but I generally hated using them because they made my hair look and feel like that of a New Jersey bouncer. I really don't like having greasy hair.\n\nIm really glad I got to try this stuff. While it goes on like a regular styling cream, once it dries it actually makes your hair softer than before, and yet somehow stays in place. Basically, if you have thick unmanageable hair, this stuff will somehow change your hair on a molecular level to the normal hair of a person that dated in high school.\n\nIt smells fine, but not something you normally associate with hair. Sort of like standing between a hair salon and an Italian restaurant, in terms of scent. I assume that's due to the Rosemary.\n\nSo, given that this stuff is so great, why four stars instead of five? Because its overpriced. Jack Black recently lowered the amount of product, but kept the price the same. The tube you get is far less than half full. Unless they were losing money before, they are price gouging now.  You used to get about 18% more in a bottle than you do now. Unlike a pomade, youll go through a bottle of this fairly quickly with daily use, so I think $15 is a bit high. In fact, it works out to be about as expensive per ounce as the historical value of silver. Or $550 per gallon. No matter how you look at it, this is a lot of money for stuff you put in your hair.

I have been working out a lot this year and counting calories, and I have lost more than 30 pounds.  I've been trying different anti-cellulite products to get a little extra help, appearance-wise.  I've been using this one for a few weeks now.\n\nIt is hard to tell if this is working.  I know that 95% of reducing cellulite is diet and exercise, so I have seen some improvement simply because of those factors.  I don't necessarily think any of it is due to this product in particular.  (I am just using this on the outer thighs and rear end, twice per day.  It is probably going to last about six weeks at the rate I am going, which is a reasonable period of time for a product of this size)  I am not noticing much change at all.  (In fairness, with other products, I do occasionally feel like I see a difference.)\n\nThe other thing is, I really don't like the oil format.  It doesn't absorb well into the skin at all and leaves a sheen of oil over where I've applied it, as well as on my hands.  There are some other body oils I use on occasion that don't have this problem.  But I really don't like the greasy feeling I get after I apply this.  (I ordered straight from Nuxe so I know I have a legitimate bottle of product.  The pump works well and it is plastic, which is nice -- I don't care for body care products in glass bottles, which can break very easily in *my* bathroom.)  Also, you do have to massage this in for a long time -- that's in the instructions on the package.  So this may not be for impatient people!\n\nIt is not causing any irritation or sensitivity-type reactions, so that's good.  I don't notice a strong smell or really any scent at all.  (I have constantly clogged sinuses, though, so maybe I am not the best judge...)\n\nPlease note this has some tree nut and sesame-derived ingredients, so avoid if you have those allergies.  You can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the product images.\n\nIn the end, you will get the most results from diet and exercise.  For supplementary purposes, I find massage with a cellulite massager and coffee scrub in the shower on the affected areas, plus using a body cream containing retinol twice a day to be most effective.

It smells great, like all their products, and moisturizes like a dream!  The skin under my eyes has never ever felt SO SMOOTH and wrinkle free. I started using it on a couple other spots on my face because it minimizes wrinkles so well. Dark circles appeared lessened because of improved hydration, tone, etc.  This one was my clear winner.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Womens-Eye-Contour-Serum/dp/B0087CRJDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Womens Eye Contour Serum</a>\nBright white and thicker cream has virtually zero scent. It is very gentle and felt like nothing at all, so I wore this one under makeup during the day. It soaks in super fast and doesn't feel greasy, but lasts for hours. Definitely helped reduce puffiness. Maybe a bit on the dark circles, too.  Second choice. I'd buy this one again! Contains: eyeliss and haloxyl.

The scent is a little too strong, but still pleasant and floral. Left my skin feeling very smooth, and very moisturized at first, but didn't last long enough. One pump gel goes a very long way, so I ended up smearing most of it on my face. Not intense enough for my dry, baggy under-eye skin.

It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.\n\nHere's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon\n-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)\n-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)\n-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner\n-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )\n**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**\n-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)\n-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum\n\n(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is \"Black don't crack\". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)\n\n***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.\n\nI hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases!

I'm not doubting that the people may have unfortunately received a fake product but what I am saying is that unless the company website sent me a fake mine says \"Eyelash Formula\".  Enough of that, let's move on to  the review part.  I'm hypothyroid & take Armour.  I'm not sure if it was that condition, alopecia areata or my low Ferritin level (21) but my eyelashes had fallen out in clumps on one eye & both eyes a few times over the past couple years.  This last time was the worst, they also dropped to about half the length.  They were so short it was difficult to even get them in my eyelash curler. You don't realize what eyelashes do for your eyes until you are without them.  I looked tired all the time, I was depressed & embarrassed.  I had to apply individual lashes because I looked crazy & the amount of time that added to my daily routine was a real pain.  I had started taking iron supplements & have more than doubled my Ferritin level.  According to my endo & google searches optimal level is 70 & below that can cause hair loss.  (Please don't read this & start taking iron supplements without getting your levels checked by a physician as you can become sick & cause other health issues.)  I had also just started using this product.  I want to be clear that while getting my Ferritin level up may have helped this product seems to be like Miracle Gro for my lashes.  They are longer & fuller than they ever were in about a month.  I have dry eyes (thanks thyroid) and the first few days GrandeLASH MD did seem to irritate them & I almost gave up but after a few days my eyes were fine.  I'm so glad I kept at it.  I am 44 so according to the directions I apply at night after I wash my face & then again in the morning after I wash my face & before any makeup. For less than $20 a month it's so worth it.  I keep checking the mirror to be sure my lashes are still there.  They actually look like I have my individual lashes on.  I couldn't be more happy & relieved.

It seems to stay on my nails longer than Gelish, which peels off after about three or four days.\n\nMy only complaint about this product is that the bottles have more polish than you will ever use. This is because of the \"goo factor\" after two or three applications. The manufacturers might consider going to a smaller bottle at a cheaper price.\n\nI received many compliments on this Rubble color.

It's juicy, and strong.\n\n  After a few minutes, Artisan evens out with a pleasing floral note (orange blossoms, as I'm told), and you catch hints of aromatic wood and sweet musk.

I'm a big fan of Reuzel and I use several of their products everyday.  The Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm) are the first Reuzel products I have ever been disappointed with.\n\nThe directions on the label instruct to apply this product to a clean, towel dried beard (I normally use beard oil in this manner). The problem is that this product contains no natural oils, only a bunch of unnecessary chemicals. The only up side is that it also contains Reuzel's T-4 Tonic Blend which is beneficial. But your beard needs more than just that. It needs natural oils and conditioners, not all the chemicals.  I prefer the results I get with all natural products.  My beard is softer, healthier and more manageable when using my regular products.\n\nMy regular routine consists of a quality beard oil right out of the shower, massaging it into the skin and brushing it through the hair with a boar bristle brush. I let the oil absorb while I tend to other things.  A few minutes later I apply a beard balm that contains Shea Butter, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Apricot Kernel Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Beeswax, and Cocoa Seed Butter. Then at the end I apply a little beard wax to provide the hold. This gives me a soft, healthy, manageable beard without any chemicals and no long term hair damage. The results of my routine are far superior to the Reuzel Beard Foam & Beard Balm combo.\n\nOkay, the scent...  I know full well that smells are subjective, but... this Beard Foam STINKS!!  At first it smells like soap, --so far so good-- BUT then it goes through a bad breath stage, which progresses into to a plastic/rubbery smell, then it finally settles into a powdery scent, similar to the Beard Balm.  This powdery scent then lingers on, and on, and on, and on...  I personally HATE  powdery smells, so if you're like me avoid the Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm, it's even worse).  However, if you're one of those weirdos that actually wants to smell like a big 'ol powder puff, well... you're going to love it.\n\nSpeaking to the 'deodorizing' properties, I suppose if you just finished eating your girlfriend's second-hand tuna sandwich the Beard Foam may provide a slight improvement to your beard's smell.
